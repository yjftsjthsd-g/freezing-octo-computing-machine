manages background processes, hopefully soon including the ability to restart on failure

I'm still working out how this should actually work; the current version tracks child processes by local file $PROCESSNAME.status
Probably next iteration will handle keep-alive function via helper script that just loops and keeps at least one copy live until the helper is killed (does killing a script kill its child?)
